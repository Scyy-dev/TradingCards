# All messages use the '&' symbol for the minecraft default colouring/formatting

# If you want a message to not have the prefix, tag it at the start of the message '[NO_PREFIX]'
# Make sure the tag is the VERY start, no format codes or anything
# e.g. noPermission: "[NO_PREFIX]&cYou do not have permission to use that command"

# Prefix for all messages
prefix: "&7[&cTrading&6Cards&7] &f"

errorMessages:
  noPermission: "&cYou do not have permission for that command"
  invalidCommand: "&cThat was not a recognised command"
  cannotOpenSign: "&cCould not display sign information. Please try again in a few moments."
