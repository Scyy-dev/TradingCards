#    Customisable Player Messages
# -================================-
# All messages use the '&' symbol for the minecraft default colouring/formatting

# If you want a message to not have the prefix, tag it at the start of the message '[NO_PREFIX]'
# Make sure the tag is the VERY start, no format codes or anything
# e.g. noPermission: "[NO_PREFIX]&cYou do not have permission to use that command"

# Prefix for all messages
prefix: "&7[&3Trading&6Cards&7] &f"
